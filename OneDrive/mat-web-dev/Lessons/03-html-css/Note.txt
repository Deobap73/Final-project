What is CSS?

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

Using CSS

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
- Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
- Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
- External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

## CSS Selectors

A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
-  selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
- This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.
